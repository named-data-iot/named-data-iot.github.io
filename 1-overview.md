			<h1>A Quick Overview of NDN-Lite</h1>
		</header>

<p>The NDN-Lite library implements the Named Data Networking Stack with the high-level application support functionalities and low-level OS/hardware adaptations for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="content">Architecture</h2>
<p>The architecture of NDN-Lite library is independent of the OS and the development kit.
The exposed API makes the library easily pluggable to IoT Software Development Kit (SDK) and IoT Operating Systems, by creating a thin adaptation layer between the platform and the NDN-Lite.

<p>The library was designed to provide more than core NDN network stack.
The library allows applications to directly integrate supporting functionalities including Access Control, Service Discovery, Schematized Trust and so on.</p>
